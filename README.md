## Conclusions
- Annual income of the customer has a high influence on determining whether the customer is likely to default or not. Lower the annual income, higher the chance of default.
- Interest rate is also a good driver variable in determining if the customer is likely to default. Higher the interest rate, higher chance of default.
- Grade is one of the best variable to predict default. Giving loan to E, F and G category can be one of a good ways to reduce default.
- dti(debt to income ratio) shows a good trend of increasing default with increase in dti. As debt increases or income decreases, the customer is more likely to default
